\usage{
get_seg_scale(segments, nseg, scale = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{segments}{list with basis segments and their corresponding indices in the original profile, obtianed by \code{get_segs()}}

\item{nseg}{integer. \code{nseg} = 3: increase the length of the third basis segment.}

\item{scale}{integer. The scale of the increased segment.
\code{scale} = 1: the length remains the same;
\code{scale} = 2: the length will be doubled. If \code{len} = 50, the length of the returned segment will be 100;
\code{scale} = 3: the length will be doubled twice. If \code{len} = 50, the length of the returned segment will be 200.}
}
\value{
list consisting of
\itemize{
\item \code{aug_seg}: the increased segment
\item \code{aug_idx}: the corresponding indices in the profile
}
}
\description{
In order to identify the congruent registration position of a basis segment,
the length of the basis segment will be doubled to compute the correlation curve.
\code{get_seg_scale} computes the increased segment, which has the same center
as the basis segment.
